## About Me

I am a PhD student in the computer science department of the National University of Singapore. Before that, I was a master's student in Greece in the program "Algorithms, Logic, Discrete MAthematics" (alma.di.uoa.gr). I am broadly interested in the intersection of theoretical computer science and pure math. I am excited to know about deep non-algorithmic theories and their potential applications in CS theory, but here are the fields I have given the most time to, in alphabetic order. 

## Directions of interest

- **Applications of pure math to theoretical computer science** 
- **Computational Complexity:** Meta-complexity
- **Graph Theory:** Structural, Probabilistic
- **Recursion theory:** Algorithmic Randomness

## Material
Here are some materials I have worked on. I am presently focused on my PhD studies, but I add a few updates when time permits.

### [Paper] Maximum degree in minor-closed clases.
Every planar graph is a minor of a planar graph of maximum degree 3. What if we replaced "planar" with another minor-closed class? 

We have written a paper with professors Agelos Georgakopoulos and David Wood. Presently, we are making the otherwise complete text easier to read. [Take a look](https://github.com/Orestis-Milolidakis/Maximum-Degree-Of-Minor-Closed-Classes) at a version of our work from the end of November! My PhD studies have been surprisingly intense, and I decided to put off the refinements until the Summer semester to fully focus on my PhD.

### Master's thesis

[NEW] Here is the official text of my master's thesis [master's thesis](https://github.com/Orestis-Milolidakis/Masters-thesis/blob/main/Master's%20thesis%20official.pdf)
 advised by Agelos, on which the paper is based.

Here is a video presentation. Parts [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b9jxNKCgKs&t=180s) and [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5fkjAzQ8ts).

I presented my thesis on the [Noon Seminar](https://www.mff.cuni.cz/en/kam/teaching-and-seminars/noon-lectures/2024) of Charles-Prague University.

Here are [slides](https://github.com/Orestis-Milolidakis/Presentation-Slides/blob/main/Masters_thesis_presentation.pdf) I made to present the thesis to my school.

### Undergraduate thesis
Here is an [overview of single source unsplittable](https://github.com/Orestis-Milolidakis/Bachelor-Thesis
) flows in graph theory, advised by professor Stavros Kolliopoulos. For Greek lovers.

### Presentations
Here are [slides](https://github.com/Orestis-Milolidakis/Presentation-Slides/tree/main
) of 5 presentations I made for classes during my studies.
