## About Me

This website is under construction. Check back again for material. Hello! I am a master's student in Greece in the program "Algorithms, Logic, Discrete MAthematics" (alma.di.uoa.gr). I am broadly interested in the intersection of theoretical computer science and pure math. In general I am excited to know all about deep non-algorithmic theories and their potential applications in CS theory, but here are the fields I have given the most time to, in alphabetic order.

## Directions of interest

- **Applications of pure math to theoritical computer science** 
- **Computational Complexity:** Time bounded Kolmogorov Complexity, Meta-complexity
- **Graph Theory:** Structural, Probabilistic
- **Recursion theory:** Algorithmic Randmoness

## Material

 ### test

- **Paper** 
- **Master's thesis** 
- **Undergraduate thesis**
